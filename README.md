# About
This project is based on the Walmart Sales Dataset , which provides information about the weekly sales of 45 Walmart stores for the years 2010-2012. The dataset includes various factors such as holidays, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment, allowing us to explore the relationship between these factors and weekly sales.

# Objectives
The main objective of this project is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the columns and weekly sales in Walmart stores. We aim to test the hypothesis that how these factors influences the weekly sales performance. 

# Tools
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn , matplotlib and seaborn.
